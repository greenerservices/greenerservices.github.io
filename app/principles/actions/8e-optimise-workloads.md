A workload is a service, application, or process that uses resources like storage, memory, and computing power

Optimising workloads minimises resource consumption.

###  (i) Use energy-efficient compute resources with economical compute 

Use energy-efficient compute resources with economical compute to power consumption ratios. This will optimise workloads for smaller instances.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Energy efficient compute means less resources consumed.
