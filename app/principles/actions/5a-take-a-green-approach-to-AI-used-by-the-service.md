The use of Artificial Intelligence on a service could include analysing datasets, such as satellite or weather data. It could also generative AI to create new content, ushc as text.

These technologies may bring about benefits as well as costs from an environmental sustainability standpoint.

###  (i) Be clear on the use case for AI

Be clear on the use case for GenAI/LLMs and whether an alternative non-generative AI approach e.g. image recognition, natural language processing would be more appropriate.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of generative AI that create text.

[AI Playbook for the UK Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-playbook-for-the-uk-government/artificial-intelligence-playbook-for-the-uk-government-html#using-ai-safely-and-responsibly): 'Assess the environmental impact of training and/or deploying your AI system before commencing development. Consider whether the impact represents a reasonable trade-off between benefits and energy consumption, and whether a less energy-intensive system might be able to achieve the same or similar results.'

###  (ii) Choose the appropriate size model

Services will use AI for different tasks. Small AI models can be trained for a specific task, are cost effective, quick (as there is less data for them to reference) and they can be run on basic hardware (such as a PC or phone).

Having good AI evaluation/performance metrics will allow teams to make effective choices about the smallest model they can 'get away with' using.

###  (iii) Reuse existing models where possible

Consider building on an existing model rather than starting a new one from scratch.

###  (iv) Carefully choose supplier and region

Choosing the right AI supplier and location is important. You can reduce the carbon footprint by training models in low-carbon regions or times of day.

Keep in mind the other environmental impacts of AI, especially water use. Always consider regional differences. For example. water use will have a different impact in Scotland than Suffolk.

Use third-party auditors to help select the most environmentally-friendly supplier.

Teams might be able to swap a well-known model for a more sustainable and similarly-effective option (e.g. DistilBERT vs BERT) - especially if they have the service performance metrics to support their decision
