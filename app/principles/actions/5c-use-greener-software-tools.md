###  (i) Use shared tooling

Digital shared tooling allows team members to work together on projects from anywhere.

{% from "govuk/components/details/macro.njk" import govukDetails %}

{{ govukDetails({
  summaryText: "Read more",
  text: "Coming soon!"
}) }}

###  (ii) Share documents using platforms synchronised with a shared server

A large email attachment can equate to the carbon footprint of 5 plastic carrier bags.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Sharing documents on a shared server can save resource use compared to other methods.

{{ govukDetails({
  summaryText: "Read more",
  html: "Coming soon!"
}) }}

###  (iii) Uninstall unused software

Uninstall software that is no longer being used by a team.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Unistalling software can save on resources.
