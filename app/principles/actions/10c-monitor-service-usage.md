###  (i) Ensure measurement tooling is available
Hosting platforms should provide access to tools or data to measure cost and emissions. Use service level objectives (SLOs) to set up automated reporting and dashboards.   

#### Environmental benefit: 
The right measurement tooling and reporting enables identification of where efficiences can be found for live services.

###  (ii) Measure impacts per transaction
Measuring on a per transaction basis means quantifying the impacts of individual API calls, orders, or other transactions processed. 

#### Environmental benefit: 
Insight on a per transaction basis will support data-driven decision-making on reducing environmental impacts.

### (iii) Apply tagging to resources
Tagging resources builds on good FinOps practice. It enables granular reporting of consumption and emissions.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Insight on a per transaction basis supports data-driven decision-making on how to reduce environmental impacts.
