Notifications, such as emails or text messages, have a carbon footprint. The same applies to any documentation that a service might produce. There are however approaches we can take to reduce these environmental costs.

###  (i) Take a lean approach to notifications

Notifications like emails have a carbon footprint. This can increase when they have attachments. For services with many users, these impacts can quickly mount.

Take a lean approach to notifications by:

• Only sending emails, SMS, website and other notifications when genuinely needed
• Keeping notifications as lightweight (as small a file size) as possible
• Setting up notifications so users can turn them off or choose how often to receive them.  

#### Environmental benefit: 
These approaches can help reduce data transfer and associated energy consumption.

{% from "govuk/components/details/macro.njk" import govukDetails %}

{{ govukDetails({
  summaryText: "Read more",
  text: "Coming soon!"
}) }}

###  (ii) Choose lightweight publishing formats

Document format choices can impact file sizes and data transfer. For example, the HTML publishing format has lower file sizes than PDFs.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Using smaller documents sizes mean less data transfer and energy use.

{{ govukDetails({
  summaryText: "Read more",
  html: "Placeholder"
}) }}
