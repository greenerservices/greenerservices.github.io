###  (i) Forecast the environmental impact of services at the solution architecture design stage

Where possible, forecast the environmental impact of service workloads at the solution architecture design stage. You should use this to inform technology choices and design decisions.  

#### Environmental benefit: 
Insight into the environmental impacts of technology choices empowers a greener choice from the start.

###  (ii) Design for service monitoring upfront

Build in consumption and emissions monitoring from the start of the project, tagging resources where possible. We could call this a 'measurable by design' mindset. 

#### Environmental benefit: 
Adding energy measurability upfront empowers a team to optimise processes.
