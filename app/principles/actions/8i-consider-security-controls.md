Digital security controls are measures that organisations implement to protect their data and systems from cyber threats. Security is one area where there may be trade-offs with sustainability that need to be negotiated.

###  (i) Optimise backups and redundancies

Improve your resilience by shortening backup retention times and removing duplicate backups. You should consider:

• if shortening retention times is possible
• the importance of duplicates and storage in security

#### Environmental benefit: 
Reduced data storage.

###  (ii) Choose the right cryptographic algorithms

Cryptographic algorithms are formulas that encrypt and decrypt data. Consider quantum computing and its impact on cryptographic algorithms.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Reduce resource usage.

###  (iii) Consider patch management

Optimize security updates to minimize unnecessary software downloads and system reboots.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Save on resource consumption.

###  (iv) Consider timing of security scans and updates

Schedule intensive security scans and updates during off-peak hours to take advantage 

#### Environmental benefit: 
Reduce carbon intensity of electricity used.

###  (v) Calculate the emissions of security controls

Calculate the emissions of security controls to identify potential reductions.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Identify opportunities to reduce resource consumption.
