It is important that service teams understand the outcomes that policymakers are seeking to deliver, including any goals relating to the environment. 

In some circumstances, teams may have the opportunity to work closely with policymakers to define the goals and outcomes sought.

###  (i) Understand any policy goals relating to sustainability

Policy might have broad goals for a service relating to sustainability, including economic, social or environmental outcomes. 

As an example, some services in the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) aim to boost material recycling or biodiversity. Many other services in government are primarily focused on social outcomes, and in those cases, the service team can focus on delivering those whilst simultaneously delviering a service that is as environmentally sustainable as it can be.

You should be clear about the outcomes your service will help achieve. 

#### Environmental benefit: 
Having clarity on policy goals relating to sustainability from the start helps ensure teams design to deliver these.

###  (ii) Engage in open policymaking where possible

Open policy making can help create policy based on evidence, participation and experimentation. It relies on collaborative methods to iterate policy that meets complex and evolving user needs.

Open policy making supports real world problem-solving, accountability, and 'socially grounded decision making'.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Open policy making helps us deliver the outcomes, including those relating to sustainability, sought by policy.
