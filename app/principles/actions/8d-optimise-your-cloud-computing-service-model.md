###  (i) Move from rented Infrastructure to Platform and Serverless solutions where appropriate

Serverless architecture lets us create and run application without having to manage infrastructure.

Move from rented Infrastructure (IaaS) to Platform (PaaS) and Serverless solutions where appropriate

#### Environmental benefit: 
Serverless architectures allow flexibility, scalability and higher efficiency.

###  (ii) Choose the greenest instance type or stock-keeping unit for compute and storage

A cloud instance type is a virtual server in a cloud computing environment that is designed for specific workloads. Choose an instance type that best aligns with your workload needs.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Efficient instance types will lead to reduced energy consumption

###  (iii) Design workloads for portability to take advantage of renewable electricity availability

Designing for portability allows you to move application and data between cloud environments. This includes moving these between public and private cloud, or between different providers.

#### Environmental benefit: 
Allows workloads to run in different data centres when low carbon electricity is available.
