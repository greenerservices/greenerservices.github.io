Hardware has very significant ‘embodied’ environmental impacts coming from the sourcing of raw materials, processing, manufacture, distribution and disposal of equipment at the end of it's life. These go beyond carbon to include things like:

• freshwater use
• resource depletion
• human and ecosystem toxicity
• land use change (including deforestation)
• biodiversity loss

Applying the principles of the 'circular economy' to hardware itself (by sharing, leasing, re-using, repairing and refurbishing) helps reduce the need for the manufacture of new equipment and saves on the associated environmental impacts.
