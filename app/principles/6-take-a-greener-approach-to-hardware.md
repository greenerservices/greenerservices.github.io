Hardware has very significant ‘embodied’ environmental impacts coming from the sourcing of raw materials, processing, manufacture, distribution and disposal of equipment at the end of it's life.

These go beyond carbon to include things like:

• freshwater use
• resource depletion
• human and ecosystem toxicity
• land use change (including deforestation)
• biodiversity loss

Applying the principles of the 'circular economy' to hardware itself (sharing, leasing, re-using, repairing and refurbishing) help reduce the need for the manufacture of new equipment and save on the associated environmental impacts.

At the same time, Cloud, AI and software all need hardware. Doing less in the cloud or using less AI can indirectly reduce the need for more hardware.
