Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used in ways that help deliver a range of environmental benefits. For example, it might allow us to make processes more efficient, or identify opportunities to reduce waste.

However, AI comes at an environmental cost. This includes things like:

• high energy consumption for the training of models
• large water use for cooling
• potential pollution from the mining of raw materials for AI chips.
• discarded hardware creating electronic waste
