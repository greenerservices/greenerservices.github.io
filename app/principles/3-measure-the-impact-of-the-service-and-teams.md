  key: 3. Measure the impact of the service and teams
  parent: Principles

We need to measure the environmental impacts of our services and the teams delivering them in order to be confident our actions are serving to reduce these. Publishing our approaches to measurement and our results is also a key step in developing a culture of transparency and learning.

  <p class="govuk-body">If you are not yet able to accurately measure you service's emissions, make a start with what you can do and the data you are able to access. This could include tools to help with estimating impacts, using proxy measures, or following the approach of best practice examples and case studies.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">NB: A cross-UK government working group is looking at standardised methodologies for calculating the lifeycle emissions of cloud and end-user devices. This principle will be updated in due course based on their outputs.</p>
