We need to understand policy intent and any particular sustainability goals as part of the problem space for a service.

<div class="govuk-inset-text app-wcag-callout">
  <p class="govuk-body">This principle applies before service delivery begins, when a range of interventions, including non-digital, may be under consideration. It is important as decisions may be made up front about the nature and shape of a service, including the technology that will be used to deliver it, and how the service relates to other interventions alongside it. These decisions can be costly to change tack on later in projects, and may in some cases be embedded in primary legislation.</p>
